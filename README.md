# Programming Assignment : 2-player-game

## Overview

This assignment involves creating a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should allow players to take turns, display the current game status, and provide an option to reset the game at any time.

## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid by two players who alternately place their marks (X or O) in empty squares. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of one's own marks.

## Requirements

- **Turn-Based Play**: Players should be able to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board.
- **Win Detection**: The game should detect when a player has won by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of their marks.
  - After the win, the game should stop and display the winner.
  - Only resetting, will aloow the game to be started
- **Game Status Display**: Display the current game status at the top of the interface, indicating whose turn it is, announcing the winner, or declaring a draw if applicable.
- **Reset Functionality**: Include a "Reset" button that allows players to restart the game at any time.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
